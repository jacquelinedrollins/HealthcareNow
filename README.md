## Application Concept: :triangular_flag_on_post:
Once the Affordable Care Act was signed into law in 2010, having health insurance became mandatory. Deciding on a plan can be laborious especially with for those with low levels of health literacy. The target population for our project are young adults looking to find a health plan that fits their needs.


**Team Members:** :triangular_flag_on_post:
```
1. Ian Crueldad
2. Jacquie Rollins
3. Elmira Akbaripourdibazar
4. Monica Montano
5. Farhad Turabi 
```

**Stakeholders:** :triangular_flag_on_post:
```
* Campus represenativies
* Students
* Healthcare agencies and hospitals
* Leaders in the healthcare field
* Health insurance providers
```

#### Requirements: :triangular_flag_on_post:
* User Log In
* Collect User Info
* Make a database
* Provide best healthcare plan


#### User Stories: :triangular_flag_on_post:
```
1. User should be able to log in
2. User should be able to add information to their profile
3. User should be able to input their healthcare needs and health symptoms 
4. Gather data from users to assess their health needs
5. Based on the information we gather about user’s health need; application will provide a system that determines the best health plans  for users

```


#### Completion Times for User Stories: :triangular_flag_on_post:
```
1. User should be able to log in: 5 days
2. User should be able to add information to their profile: *5 days*
3. User should be able to select their health symptoms and needs:  *4 days*
4. Gather data from users to assess their health needs:  1 month
5. Based on the information we gather about user’s health need; application will provide a system that determines the best health plans for users:  *1 month*
6. Create a public and private key that would indicate what information belongs to what user without showing an obvious public connection of which public keys belong to which private keys: *3 days*
```


#### Example of User Stories: :triangular_flag_on_post:

    • I am a F1 visa student. I go to the gym a lot. I have noticed occasionally that I tend to strain some of my muscles after a hard work out.  I am looking for the best insurance plan for me in case I injure myself.* 

    • I am a 25-year-old who is about to be dropped from my parent’s health plan. I engage in multiple risky behaviors in addition to  having multiple mental health problems.  I want to have a health plan that will address my needs for the lowest cost.*

    • I am a 23-year-old student who just found out I am pregnant. I still haven’t decided what I want to do so I’d like to know my    different options regarding abortion, adoption, and maternal child health.*

    • I am uninsured and have been recently diagnosed with cervical cancer. I would like to know what services and treatments are      available to me.

    • Currently, I am a 20-year-old student who is in the middle of joining a sorority. I have decided to live in the house owned by my sorority. I blacked out and slept with a guy and did not realize that protection was not used. After being in pain and noticed a      rash, I consulted Web MD. I have realized there is a high chance that I contracted herpes. I hope there is a plan the offers a reduced cost on generic drugs.*

    • I am a 22-year-old transgender female who was recently diagnosed with HIV. This situation prompted me to stop using crystal meth. I need rehabilitation services and long-term HIV care.  In addition, I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, therefore I need dialectical behavioral therapy.*

![Test Coverage](https://github.com/Crueldad/HealthcareNow/blob/master/Test%20Coverage.png)



-------
## The three most important things we learned about software development in our project: :triangular_flag_on_post:
1. We learned that it is crucial to have at least two people understand different scripting languages and other software used in the project in case of complications.
2. It is more advantageous to complete the project if the code is written in an efficient (functional) manner and is applicable to various scenarios.
3. Roles should be established at the beginning of the project based on the expertise of each person. furthermore;  there should be a working document detailing user stories to help find our path at each iteration.
